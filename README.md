# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Migration Model Calculation

## Overview

This project provides a Python implementation of a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) migration model calculation. The model computes CLV using various data frames that inform the calculation through rates, contributions, retentions, and other relevant metrics. It includes methods to handle future projections and outlier remediation, ensuring accurate and reliable results.

## Features

- **Data Frame Splitting**: Separates the main DataFrame into rule, retention, and contribution DataFrames for streamlined processing.
- **Retention Rate Matrix Calculation**: Computes retention rates while handling outliers and ensuring data integrity.
- **Contribution Value Matrix Calculation**: Calculates ratio matrices from contribution data, considering only non-zero values.
- **CLV Year Matrix Calculation**: Computes the Customer Lifetime Value for each period based on retention and contribution matrices.
- **Future Projection**: Extends matrices to predict future retention rates, contributions, and CLV over specified future periods.
- **Outlier Handling**: Implements an outlier remedy method to handle anomalies in the data, ensuring robust calculations.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
